### What even is this?
Good question. It's a Discord bot made in python using *discord.py* at the time of writing this.  
It's a personal project for me to get better at development in general (I have a long way to go, but progress is being made, I think) and at Python in this case. And well making a Discord bot seemed like a fun idea, so there's that :]

### How to install?
**Don't.** 

Well, you could. But it's in constant development and it doesn't have that many features so I didn't think it was the time to make an install guide yet.

### Can I fork this and use it as my own bot?
Do you like spaghetti code and obscure code practices? Then you're good to go. 
It's under a MIT license. Do anything you want with this.  
You can even share it with me, or tell me about improvements I can make or issues you have found!
